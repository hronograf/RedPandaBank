# 🐼💰 RedPandaBank 🐼💰

RedPandaBank is a Telegram bot that helps parents track how their children are doing with homework, measure their academic progress, and more. The bot is designed around the character of a red panda, who is always ready to help children and teach them about investing.

## 🏠 HOMEWORK AND STUDY MANAGEMENT

The application allows children to create a to-do list for the day and mark off what they have done. Parents can check completed work and add new tasks if needed. Children can also earn coins for completing tasks and for extra assignments.

## 🎓 ACADEMIC PROGRESS TRACKING

The application helps parents track their child's academic progress and monitor completion of homework.

## 💰 INVESTING EDUCATION

In addition, children will have the opportunity to learn about investing. The family will have its own coin, which will be tied to real money. Parents set the coin's exchange rate. For example, 1 BLC (this is the name of our family's coin, you will have your own) may cost $1 today, and tomorrow 1 coin may be worth $3. The price is controlled by the parent. This will be a simulation of a real exchange so that the child understands what volatility, pump, dump, and so on are. I will record short instructional videos when the application is ready.

## 📅 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT

The application also provides the ability to work with a schedule so that children always know what they need to do at any given moment.

RedPandaBank is an excellent tool for parents who want to help their children learn how to work, invest, and manage their time. When children feel more confident and in control of their tasks, they often learn better and become more successful in life. 🚀
